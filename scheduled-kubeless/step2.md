## Start Kubernetes

The first step of this tutorial is to start up the Kubernetes cluster. It is done automatically, but it takes some time.

You can use `launch.sh`{{execute}} to check the progress. The command should print `Kubernetes started` when the cluster is ready.

Throughout this tutorial we'll use the Kubernetes CLI called `kubectl` ([Cheat Sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/))

Let's make sure everything is working by running `kubectl cluster-info`{{execute}}, which will tell you information about the Kubernetes cluster, such as if and where it is running.

Once the cluster is ready, you are ready for the next step.
