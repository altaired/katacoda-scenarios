We'll now install kubeless, which is ....

## Task

Install kubeless, by using the following commands

Fetch and export the latest kubeless version to an env variable, by running this:

`export RELEASE=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubeless/kubeless/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)`{{execute}}

Then download and unzip _Kubeless_ using this command:

`curl -OL https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/releases/download/$RELEASE/kubeless_linux-amd64.zip && \
  unzip kubeless_linux-amd64.zip && \
  sudo mv bundles/kubeless_linux-amd64/kubeless /usr/local/bin/
`{{execute}}

Before changing anything in our cluster, let's create a new _Kubernetes namespace_ to easily keep track of our Kubeless deployments.
This is done with the following command:

`kubectl create ns kubeless`{{execute}}

In order setup kubeless in our kubernetes cluser, we can use a provided yaml file from _Kubeless_.
This will create all required kubernetes components for us, do it by running this command:

`kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/releases/download/v1.0.8/kubeless-non-rbac-v1.0.8.yaml`{{execute}}

Let's see what's been created by running:

`kubectl get all`{{execute}}
