## Scenarios

### Scheduled Kubeless Function
This scenario goes through how to deploy a serverless function with scheduled execution on Kubernetes. For this, a framework called Kubeless is used as well as a sample http endpoint built by Katacoda. The tutorial expects some basic knowledge of Kubernets, one should be familiar with the core components of it. The tutorial is executed on Katacoda, which offers an interactive environment with a terminal and editor, thus it does not need you to download anything on your own machine.
